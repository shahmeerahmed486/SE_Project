## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Setup
1. Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable the following services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Firestore Database
   - Storage
   - Functions (if using Blaze plan)

3. Get your Firebase configuration:
   - Go to Project Settings
   - Find the Firebase SDK configuration
   - Create a .env.local file with these values:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

### 2. Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Fix dependency conflicts:
```bash
# Downgrade React to v18
npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Firebase Security Rules
Add these rules to your Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Public access to tournaments
    match /tournaments/{tournamentId} {
      allow read: true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
      
      // Public access to teams within tournaments
      match /teams/{teamId} {
        allow read: true;
        allow create: true;  // Allow team registration
        allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
      }
    }
    
    // Protected management routes
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
